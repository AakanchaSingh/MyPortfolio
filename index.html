											<h3>Camouflage</h3>
											<p>An Adage campaign brief was to create representations of ideas that can bring about a change in the world.
												The idea was to implore people to feel the same angst when young girls are subjected to religion/caste based violence which takes over the national sentiment when a religious symbol is in question.

											<h3>Hashtags That Heal</h3>

											<p>A part of the same brief, here we (my art partner and I) chose to represent hashtags like MeToo as something that not only revealed stories swept under the rug for years but also set women out on a journey of collective healing.</p>

											<h3>Apples & Oranges</h3>
											<p>Print Ad made as an entry for Nestle 'Power of Print' open brief - #helpparentsknowgoodfood, the idea was to spread awareness among parents about the specifics of nutritional intake for their children.</p>
											<p>The idea is that the nutritional requirements of every kid are infact apples and oranges.</p>

											<h3>Not Equal</h3>
											<p>Print Ad made as an entry for Nestle 'Power of Print' open brief - #helpparentsknowgoodfood, the idea was to spread awareness among parents about the specifics of nutritional intake for their children. Another take on the same brief.</p>
											<p>The idea: all kids are different in their nutritional requirement and in some ways an inequal treatment is the way to go</p>

													<h3> A Regular Evening </h3>
													<p>The animation bites a slice off a regular evening in a busy city. Tired and aloof yet together. Letting it's hair down, the city retires to a different time for a brief while. A time where casual evenings were not an ask but a given. A taut yarn quivers between these quiet interludes and an otherwise relentless city than never sleeps. A few moments on the vehicle home, a few long stares outside your window , a petty walk. Quiet finds its way amidst chaos. Maybe that's how hope creeps in. 
														Today, as cities cry for breath and life saving drugs, these moments of nothingness momentarily take away the burden of love and anger and desperation. For a very little while, a short moment, a fleeting - inconsequential juncture, it's okay to not be okay.

													<p>A video inquiry into the origin of ideas, with interviews from some of the creative minds around me. A startup founder, a National Creative Head, a Graphic Designer, an Artist, a Filmmaker, a Photographer, a Musician, a Design Strategist. 
														The quality is terrible owing to multiple hard drive crashes and Mr. Murphy.
